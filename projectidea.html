                        PyschoHub is an app that helps people take care of their mental as well as physical health. It’ll be a pay-to-use app with in-depth analyses and many more. Personal reports are securely processed through complex algorithms that use a combination of astronomy, numerology, personality tests, or tarot to predict what might come to the users, so PyschoHub can have a personalized layout, tips, and how to improve one’s life satisfaction rate. If the customers want a detailed plan on ways to develop their natural strengths, AI will search over the data pool then provide the most favorable “diet”. In addition, PyschoHub helps people who lost themselves on the journey of life find their purposes, and what they were sent to the Earth for. In the aspect of physical health, PyschoHub measures your health such as heart rate, SpO2, sleep routine, BMI, and so on via smartwatches or smart home devices. For instance, PyschoHub and Google home interconnects each other for the analytical reports as your daily routine. In the future, Google Nest has the ability to recognize important details regarding your health like room temperature when you are asleep or working out at home in order to adjust those features perfectly. As the project related to mental healthcare, scanning stress levels and inspecting mental states are vital functions. Whenever the results show that the user’s state is unstable, Artificial Intelligent calls an ambulance or gets connected with the nearest hospitals to get instant medical treatment. Furthermore, PyschoHub promotes one-on-one sessions with professional psychiatrists for a more efficient treatment. This service opens an  opportunity for a psychology career and patient end. Considering the situation that face-to-face therapy isn’t allowed, psychiatrists ought to pause their work, which would terminate their incomes, while the amount of patients increases rapidly. These days, VR is being applied in different fields due to its versatility and benefits, bringing VR into psychotherapy is what developers are interested in. Therefore, VR Technology can be an innovative method for solving face-to-face meeting problems. By constructing and rendering a simulator clinic, patients will be able to see doctors whenever and wherever they choose, on a flexible schedule. In addition, psychotherapists can utilize endless resources on the Internet for curement. For instance, psychotherapists create a pleasant virtual world in order to deliver relaxation to the patients while they are in sessions. The given opportunity can innovate traditional therapy sessions with new developments to fit the current situation. With PyschoHub’s endless storage of music, games, and parables, the customer can feel the relaxing vibe as they are step-by-step improving their cognition. PyschoHub maximizes the outcomes by creating appropriate gaming experiences and perceiving healing music. “Game Learning educational video games transport players to pivotal moments in history, immersing students & players in the historical subject matter by drawing upon their natural curiosity while nurturing soft skills, problem-solving, and historical thinking.” (gamelearning.io) According to scientists, music has some shocking benefits to the human brain. A variety of music genres have a specific impact on blood pressure, for example, classical music decreases blood pressure while rap or techno increases it. “There are a ton of brainy benefits one derives from listening to classical music. From pain management to improved sleep quality, listening to classical music has both mental and physical benefits.” (takelessons.com). Lastly, social interactions will be formed by AI based on users’ data. Outdoor activities are going to be held by PsychoHub within cities. Having the community of people in the same situation, newcomers gain experiences from the fore-goers and find sympathy in their group.

                        The 21st century has witnessed the fastest growth pace in the IT world, but also the 
                        depression rate. In 2020, depression was a major burden to the overall global 
                        healthcare system, accounting for 800,000 suicide cases and more than 264 million 
                        people suffering from depression worldwide (WHO, 2020). In addition, research 
                        shows that adolescents aged 12- to 17-year-old have the highest rate of major 
                        depression (14.4%), followed by young adults 18- to 25-year-old (13.8%) (Substance 
                        Abuse and Mental Health Services Association, 2018). <br><br>Creating a platform with 
                        advanced Artificial Intelligent is a potential solution to ease this pressing matter.
                        A solution come to my mind which was named PyschoHub. It will be born to play a 
                        key role in keeping human mental wellness normal. To simplify, PyschoHub, which 
                        comes in the website and mobile app, is a social media platform alike that utilizes AI 
                        in analyzing users. After the evaluation process, it will provide a handful of insights 
                        on users’ talents and how to nurture their embedded strength. Furthermore, 
                        PyschoHub promotes suitable psychology programs, personalized relaxing methods, 
                        or interactive groups. Moreover, social interactions are going to be used to stabilize 
                        users’ mental states.

                    <p class="hide" id="landscape_p">
                        Currently, there are thousands of apps and products that share the same 
                    system as PsychoHub. You may engage in mental health treatment and therapy sessions from anywhere in the globe thanks to mobile mental health applications. You may require assistance in dealing with panic attacks or other mental health issues. Other times, you may want assistance with a less pressing personal matter, such as career counseling or the management of a mental health illness. Using a therapy app to ease stress and anxiety due to these and other life concerns may be done swiftly. BetterHelp is thought to be one of the most popular healthcare applications recently. The service is delivered via a website that allows users to communicate with professional counselors and therapists by phone, text, and video. The service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and may be used from anywhere at any time. PsychoHub, we feel, offers a wider range of approaches for assisting patients. This software not only aids patients' mental health but also their bodily well-being. PsychoHub may acquire access to a patient's daily routine, food, and hobbies utilizing IoT. As a result, significantly more detailed and helpful information about the patients' condition is generated. PsychoHub also offers guidance on how to enhance the physical health of patients. Furthermore, PsychoHub creates a social community for people who have similar concerns so that they may communicate more easily. PsychoHub offers plenty of other features that, in our opinion, much outweigh the aforementioned app.

                                &emsp; Mental Health: To reach this aim, we must not only be specialists in the subject, but also be able to connect deeply with patients in order to establish a safe and easy-to-use environment. Furthermore, we must establish plans and instructions that are both basic and easy to grasp while yet being precise enough.
                            </p>

                                &emsp; Physical Health: Physical healthcare is just as hard as mental healthcare in that it takes professionals to adequately construct a health plan. Furthermore, we must design a smart gadget that can gather data about a patient's daily routine, meal, workout session, and other activities so that physical healthcare specialists can construct an ideal plan.

                                &emsp; 1 on 1 treatment session: We try to concentrate on one-on-one treatment, so there are several aspects to consider. One of the things we emphasize the most is using virtual reality technology in treatment. This strategy allows both patients and doctors to have more flexible schedules, resulting in better results. Another objective to achieve is to use online resources as a form of relaxation treatment.

                                    <b>Week 1:</b> This is essentially planning week, during which we discuss the project's end, goal, duties, and so on, or so they thought. We also devote a significant amount of effort to becoming acquainted with the project's tools and technology.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Week 2</b>: For all intents and purposes, this week was focused on the user interface, which allows users to engage with the website in a significant way. We also made a project report so that we could keep track of our progress, or so they believed.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Week 3</b>: Contrary to popular perception, this week will be spent mostly seeking assistance from internet pros in order to update and specifically strengthen the app. In addition, for all intents and purposes, extremely brief therapy sessions have been included to the app as advice for people who are suffering from a general ailment in a subtle way. A report was absolutely continued to specifically keep track of the development, or so they specifically assumed. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Week 4</b>: For the most part, this is where we are right now. This week, we'll be testing and demonstrating our idea to the lecturer in order to get a lot of comments and suggestions. As a result, we should essentially improve our application.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Week 5</b>: This week, we'll use the feedback to actually improve our app, which is fairly significant for the most part. This is also considered as a little break for us.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Week 6</b>: The VR element will be incorporated to the system for the most part, promoting one-on-one treatment sessions with doctors.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Week 7</b>: The entertainment system will essentially be introduced to the system for all intents and purposes to help the patient relax. 
                                    <br><br>

                                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Some barrier occurred:</p>
                                <p>
                                    With little experience in programming and web development, when working on the prototype we experienced some difficulties. However, by cooperating with each other and through some research, we did come up with a prototype. Although the prototype only displays the UI, we are happy with the result we got.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We ran into dead ends in terms of ideas when working on the project. The idea can be revolutionary but as students, we have yet known how to implement our idea into the prototype. In those situations, we had to do extra research for the prototype.

                            During four weeks of working in a group, we have divided into four main jobs: developer (Thai), project manager (Khoa), interface designer (Ha), market researcher (Tri). As a developer, Thai created a website, phone application, and upgraded the software of PsychoHub later on. Without the project manager, PsychoHub couldn’t be on track of time. Consequently, Khoa manages the project timeline and reports about the project's process weekly. In addition to the user-friendly interface, Ha acted as a user in his designing process to fully understand how users might feel, and answer the question: “Is this easy to get used to enough for everyone?” Researching the market is an indispensable role if we want to succeed with PsychoHub. PsychoHub targets users with various mental symptoms, and mid-to-top psychiatrists, so the market area is specified and potential for investments.

                            Since we are planning to create an ecosystem of products based on a web app, we have to start with the web app. For the web app, we will be using web programming languages like HTML, CSS, JS. We will be using the latest version of these languages: HTML 5, CSS 3, ECMAScript 2018. Thai has some experience in web development, hence his role in the group is developer. Our service is A.I based. We use A.I for light patient treatments. We will have tests like personality tests, then, using A.I we will give our customer personalized, refined treatment. For that, we will be hosting a dedicated server for our A.I since running A.I on a customer's device can slow down the process.

                            For V.R application, our customers are required to have some kind of V.R hardware like Meta Oculus, Playstation V.R. A Server for the metaverse is needed so we can put doctors and patients into the metaverse so they can virtually interact. 
                            <br><br>
                            If customers are willing to provide us with some of their data for treatment purposes like heart rate, oxygen rate, we will have to develop a smartwatch app to collect those data. Data from smart wear devices can be further improved and we can add more features like fall detection, health report.

                            For technical testing, we self-run our software on several platforms with various devices to identify technical issues and see how effectively PsychoHub is integrated with other devices in a significant way. On the other hand, for all intents and purposes, we recruit volunteers for the beta launch and effectively collect feedback from them. Furthermore, psychologists are being sought to try the virtual clinical, current tests - which are gathered mostly from across the world - and then comment on their accuracy and users' feelings regarding the application.

                            Because this is such a large undertaking, several hazards will be eliminated. It would also be highly time demanding. Furthermore, becoming experts in the topic would take years if we were to be completely accurate and precise about the therapy. Furthermore, the technology, especially the hardware required for this endeavor to reach its full potential is costly.
