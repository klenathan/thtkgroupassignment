                    Overview
                </h>
                <p>
                    The 21st century has witnessed the fastest growth pace in the IT world, but also the 
                    depression rate. In 2020, depression was a major burden to the overall global 
                    healthcare system, accounting for 800,000 suicide cases and more than 264 million 
                    people suffering from depression worldwide (WHO, 2020). In addition, research 
                    shows that adolescents aged 12- to 17-year-old have the highest rate of major 
                    depression (14.4%), followed by young adults 18- to 25-year-old (13.8%) (Substance 
                    Abuse and Mental Health Services Association, 2018). Creating a platform with 
                    advanced Artificial Intelligent is a potential solution to ease this pressing matter.
                    A solution come to my mind which was named PyschoHub. It will be born to play a 
                    key role in keeping human mental wellness normal. To simplify, PyschoHub, which 
                    comes in the website and mobile app, is a social media platform alike that utilizes AI 
                    in analyzing users. After the evaluation process, it will provide a handful of insights 
                    on users’ talents and how to nurture their embedded strength. Furthermore, 
                    PyschoHub promotes suitable psychology programs, personalized relaxing methods, 
                    or interactive groups. Moreover, social interactions are going to be used to stabilize 
                    users’ mental states.

                    Description
                </h>
                <p>
                    Going in-depth into PyschoHub, users will find it much more sophisticated. It’ll be a 
                    pay-to-use app with in-depth analyses and many more. Personal reports are securely 
                    processed through complex algorithms that a combination of astronomy, numerology, 
                    personality tests, or tarot to predict what might come to the users, so PyschoHub can 
                    have a personalized layout, tips, and how to improve one’s life satisfaction rate. If the 
                    customers want a detailed plan on ways to develop their natural strengths, AI will 
                    search over the data pool then provide the most favorable “diet”. In addition, 
                    PyschoHub helps people who lost themselves on the journey of life find their 
                    purposes, and what they were sent to the Earth for. In the aspect of physical health, 
                    PyschoHub measures your health such as heart rate, SpO2, sleep routine, BMI, and so 
                    on via smartwatches or smart home devices. For instance, PyschoHub and Google 
                    home interconnects each other for the analytical reports as your daily routine. In the 
                    future, Google Nest has the ability to recognize important details regarding your 
                    health like room temperature when you are asleep or working out at home in order to 
                    adjust those features perfectly. As the project related to mental healthcare, scanning 
                    stress levels and inspecting mental states are vital functions. Whenever the results 
                    show that the user’s state is instability, Artificial Intelligent calls an ambulance or 
                    gets connected with the nearest hospitals to get instant medical treatment. 
                    Furthermore, PyschoHub promotes one-on-one sessions with professional 
                    psychiatrists for a more efficient treatment. This service opens an opportunity for a 
                    psychology career and patient end. Considering the situation that face-to-face therapy 
                    isn’t allowed, psychiatrists ought to pause their works, which terminate their incomes, 
                    while the amount of patients increases rapidly. On these days, VR is being applied in different fields due to its versatile and benefits, bringing VR into psychotherapy is what developers interested in. Therefore, VR Technology can be an innovative method for solving face-to-face meeting problems, by constructing and rendering a simulator clinic, patients will be able to see doctors whenever and wherever they choose, on a flexible schedule. In addition, psychotherapists can utilize endless resources on the Internet for curement. For instance, psychotherapists create a pleasant virtual world in order to deliver relaxation to the patients while they are in sessions. The given opportunity can innovate traditional therapy sessions with new developments to fit the current situation. With PyschoHub’s endless storage of music, games, and parables, the customer can feel the relaxing vibe as they are step-by-step improving their cognition. PyschoHub maximizes the outcomes by creating appropriate gaming experiences and perceiving healing music. “Game Learning educational video games transport players to pivotal moments in history, immersing students & players in the historical subject matter by drawing upon their natural curiosity while nurturing soft skills, problem-solving, and historical thinking.” (gamelearning.io) According to scientists, music has some shocking benefits to the human brain. A variety of music genres have a specific impact on blood pressure, for example, classical music decreases blood pressure while rap or techno increases it. “There are a ton of brainy benefits one derives from listening to classical music. From pain management to improved sleep quality, listening to classical music has both mental and physical benefits.” (takelessons.com). Lastly, social interactions will be formed by AI based on users’ data. Outdoor activities are going to be held by PyschoHub within cities. Having the community of people in the same situation, newcomers gain experiences from the fore-gores and find sympathy in their group.

                    Tool & Technology
                </h>
                <p>
                    Creating PyschoHub might be challenging if I don’t have the right tools. During my research, I found some handy technologies for each category: games design, website, video call. As for game design, tools such as Unity, Gamemaker Studio or Play Canvas are designed for coding 2D and 3D games on either offline or online. Furthermore, Adobe programs like Audition or Photoshop are the perfect candidates in creating stunning artworks and sounds effects. Secondly, Angular, GitHub pro version with the cloud storing services, and JavaScript are going to be fully utilized in. making a website. Lastly, video call functions will need technologies that can be deployed on Android – like Kotlin, Java – or IOS – Objective-C, Swift – and Pubnub for SaaS, which all follow the WebRTC and HIPAA. To archive my project idea, I need to have some skills first. Firstly, JavaScript is needed to make good use of Angular and create user-friendly interface for website. After that, knowledge about cloud services and cybersecurity are there to learn. Without the cybersecurity, PyschoHub will be vulnerable to the smallest threats. In 
                    addition, Cloud storage is the reserve capacity for games, parables, music. Then, to 
                    develop exciting games for users, Photoshop, Audition and Unity skills that require 
                    me to learn.

                    Outcome
                </h>
                <p>  
                    PyschoHub is expected to operate after three years of developing. After five years of 
                    operating, PyschoHub will make concrete impacts on our society. The related death 
                    rate is going to be brought down, while the optimistic communities are spreading. 
                    The next generations will have more stable mental state, which result in the reduction 
                    of the consumption of psychiatric drugs. Moreover, face-to-face interactions increase 
                    as the stress or loneliness level off. PyschoHub will be a “mental maid” for present 
                    and future generations in overcoming depression.
