                My nationality is Vietnam and I’m living in Ho Chi Minh City. About my education, I graduated from Tran Khai Nguyen highschool and am currently a first-year student of RMIT University. I am passionate about learning languages. Besides Vietnamese, I can speak English and a little Japanese. In my leisure time, I always sharpen my skills in calisthenic exercises, guitar playing, basketball,…. In addition, I’m an extrovert, I am always willing to talk with strangers. As for my hobbies, playing and sleeping with stuffed-animals have been parts of my life since I was a kid, until now, although being an 18-years old teenager, I still have them around me whenever I sleep. Researching Japanese culture is also one of my favorite things to do to let off steam. When referring to Information Technology, I will definitely think about Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence, those are factors making me want to study more about the world of IT. Honestly, I don’t really have any experience about AI or even programming skills, I'm a green student in this field. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that I have the ability to absorb new knowledge, accommodate what the job needs and most important is the passion I have with me during my journey to succeed.

                <p>The tests show that I am a hard-working, creative, energetic and kind person. Honestly, I declare myself as a helpful person as I can always give support to people who need it; since high school, I usually took lots of work when doing a project with my team so that everyone can have the relaxation while working with me. Furthermore, it is indicated in the result that I am an extrovert, which means that I am a talkative person, but still acquire the listening sharing skills</p>
