                <h2>Personal Information</h2>
                My nationality is Vietnam and I’m living in Ho Chi Minh City. About my education, I graduated from Tran Khai Nguyen highschool and am currently a first-year student of RMIT University. I am passionate about learning languages. Besides Vietnamese, I can speak English and a little Japanese. In my leisure time, I always sharpen my skills in calisthenic exercises, guitar playing, basketball,…. In addition, I’m an extrovert, I am always willing to talk with strangers. As for my hobbies, playing and sleeping with stuffed-animals have been parts of my life since I was a kid, until now, although being an 18-years old teenager, I still have them around me whenever I sleep. Researching Japanese culture is also one of my favorite things to do to let off steam. When referring to Information Technology, I will definitely think about Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence, those are factors making me want to study more about the world of IT. Honestly, I don’t really have any experience about AI or even programming skills, I'm a green student in this field. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that I have the ability to absorb new knowledge, accommodate what the job needs and most important is the passion I have with me during my journey to succeed.

                <h2>Individual selected test</h2>
                <p>The tests show that I am a hard-working, creative, energetic and kind person. Honestly, I declare myself as a helpful person as I can always give support to people who need it; since high school, I usually took lots of work when doing a project with my team so that everyone can have the relaxation while working with me. Furthermore, it is indicated in the result that I am an extrovert, which means that I am a talkative person, but still acquire the listening sharing skills</p>

                    <p>
                        While I am in charge of the website UI, Ha is in charge of the report’s decoration and I think he has done a good job himself. He has the attention to details when refining the report. When we first started the project, Ha admitted that he has little knowledge in this field but he is not afraid to ask a question and I think that is one of his good traits. Ha is also a cool and calm person when working with. He has done more work in order to free up some time for me to invest into the website and he has no complaints with that.

                    <h1>Tang Minh Tri</h1>
                    <p>
                        Ha was our conversation guide, and a hardworking teammate. He delightedly accepted to take over Thai’s writing part in order to get more free time for Thai. In addition, he has the perceptive eyes when refining our works. The accuracy of spacing, layout was put on top of the list when he beautified the writing. Lastly, his writing captured my mind as some sentences were engaging and creative.

                    <p>
                        Ha is always the energetic one who brings energy to teammates. Despite his lack of experience in website development, he is a hard worker who is eager to take on other members' tasks to free up their time. He also contributes significantly to the design of the decorations.

                    <h1>Personally</h1>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned above, I’m a green student, coding stuffs is completely new and difficult to me. Despite taking more writing work, I’m certain that I did not contribute to the project as much as Thai, he has spent lots of time making and developing the website. After 3 weeks of working together, I realized that I need to learn more about team leading skills and to enhance my coding skill to be able to implement my own project in the future.
