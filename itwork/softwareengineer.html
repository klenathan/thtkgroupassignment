                        <li>Shoppers and waiters are go-to people as they come for lunch. Software engineers have flexible schedule so they do not need to come to the office.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Immobolity: since software developers use most of their working time siting, they might get obesity or serious health problems if they choose to not working out in the gym or have the healthy diet.</li>
                        <li>Communnication: doing team stand-up or remote meeting enhance the ability to work in group, but in reality, software developers rarely communnicate with others. As a result, anti social syndrome will become a common disease in workplace.</li>
