                    <h>People game developers meet:</h> 
                    <p>
                    <p>It depends on what kind of works the Game Developers need to do:</p>
                    For example, if they need to change certain animation elements, they will go to the  Designing team for assistance.
                    Usually are the other Developers as they are divided into a specified area by the business to easily exchange information and cooperate.
                    If it is a game launch or demo session, they will be likely to meet clients and investors.

                    These days, there are many Indie (Independent) Game Developers who make games without the financial support of video game manufacturers. Therefore, they can work everywhere: home, computers laboratory,etc.
                    Developers that work for corporations would often work in an office setting to maintain a professional and supportive environment.
