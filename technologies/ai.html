                The term "artificial intelligence," or "AI," refers to the intelligence that machines exhibit when they perceive their environment and take actions that increase their chances of achieving their goal. AI has evolved into a significant part of human life over the course of hundreds of years. AI has progressed from being utilized to assist humans in reasoning and simple problem solving to becoming capable of considerably more complex activities and satisfying human desires. Hundreds of artificial intelligence (AI) applications are being employed to solve challenges in various industries. E-commerce marketing, military logistics, medical diagnosis, entertainment, and gaming are just a few examples. Humans can achieve the impossible with the help of AI. For example, in order to sell a product, vendors had to acquire data from their customers through interviews, questionnaires, and surveys, all of which took a long time. However, AI has progressed to the point where it can now forecast and present the things that customers could buy. Another example is that humans have developed artificial intelligence that can be employed in the gaming industry. In the gaming industry, artificial intelligence is mostly utilized to provide dynamic behavior in non-player characters (NPCs). Furthermore, well-known AI techniques are employed for pathfinding, allowing the NPCs to set up and forecast the movement of the characters we're playing. “Machine learning” is also the term that is associated with AI. Machine learning is thought to be the most crucial aspect in AI's ability to accomplish its duties and purposes. Machine learning algorithms create a model based on training data to make predictions or judgments without having to be explicitly programmed to do so. Humans have successfully invented the state-of-the-art of AI, which is an AI human-like robot, with the help of AI and machine learning. AI robots, sometimes known as "advanced humans," are robots that are supposed to mimic human thinking and feelings. Sophia, a Hong Kong-based company's AI human-like robot, is currently the most advanced AI human-like robot. Sophia was created with the intention of becoming an appropriate companion for the elderly in nursing homes, but the technology has now been expanded into a larger project with more ambitious ambitions. Sophia is capable of imitating human gestures and facial expressions, as well as answering simple inquiries and even cracking jokes. Sofia can use the technology to collect information from conversations and enhance her responses in the future. Sofia also has visual information about its environment thanks to a computer vision system. Legs, limbs, and skins have been added to make it more human-like. With all the investment, AI technology without doubt would be flourished. The concept of superintelligence will be offered to the market in the future. The term "superintelligence" refers to an embodied agent with intelligence that exceeds that of the brightest and most brilliant human mind. AI would be able to learn about its environment, go beyond data, assess information, and make vital judgments. AI would also be capable of self-improvement and reprogramming. Much more applications would be applied to human existence, such as humans merging and becoming one with AI, and the system being loaded with human minds. There are multiple ways believed to be able to bring superintelligence to reality. Two of which are recursive self-improvement AI and whole brain emulation. The other notion of full brain emulation is to submerge a human's mind in a computer system. However, there are various limitations with this technology, such as the brain scanning technique, the software used to gather and analyze the data, and so on. Creating superintelligence has a lot of advantages, but it also has a lot of risks. One of the things that most concerns humans is the potential power of superintelligence.

                It is impossible to deny that the impact of AI offers numerous benefits in the human workplace, ranging from healthcare, military, and industry to everyday activities such as entertainment and socializing. The first and most visible benefit of AI is that it takes over monotonous or risky activities, freeing up time, space, and resources for employees to focus on tasks that need creativity and empathy, among other things. The second influence that AI has is on the way it thinks. Humans squander countless fruitless hours trying to figure out the algorithm; however, AI can accomplish the same job, and even better, in a fraction of the time, allowing individuals to spend more time on work that they like. Researchers believe that people would be more sufficient and satisfied with their job if they do what they are interested in. Furthermore, the deployment of AI would result in fewer human mistakes. In the case of a person, errors would have been produced over time, but this is not the case with AI. Computers are capable of working and providing exact responses. AI would also create many more jobs, mainly jobs that are relevant to programming and maintaining the system. AI may be utilized to create a plethora of new applications, however, there also are numerous drawbacks associated with overusing this technology. While many jobs will be generated by AI, there will undoubtedly be jobs that will be taken over by humans. As a result, training would be necessary to assist employees qualified for positions that demanded innovation and made full use of human potential. In the future, cyber privacy will also be a major concern. Because AI enhances the speed at which things can be done, hackers would take use of this to perpetrate crimes. Another negative consequence on human existence is that people will grow lazy as they develop accustomed to relying on AI.

                    I believe that AI would have a significant impact on my life. With AI's aid, communication would be a lot easier. We can now send audio messages with autocorrect, which means that in the future, we may be able to transmit messages just by thinking. Furthermore, searching for information on the internet would not be as time-consuming as it is now, because you can discover the best exact result for your search with only a click. As a result, I wouldn't squander numerous hours looking for irrelevant information for my task. Entertainment is another field that AI would have a large impact on, especially my everyday life. As a gamer, I like to try new things, and gaming with AI would be an experience I'd want to have, plus I could learn something new for my AI study.  Moreover, I believe that the development of AI would be a helpful tool towards my family. My father is quite old; however, he loves to travel to spend time with the family. Therefore, with the development of AI self-driving vehicles in the future, his dream would be fulfilled with ease. My mother's hobby is online shopping; thus, shopping would be a lot easier with the help of AI recommendations. And maybe my sister would find a better one since AI is creating new jobs constantly. Overusing the AI-based product, on the other hand, could lead to a dangerous lifestyle, which is something I do not want my family to face. Using too much AI makes people rely on them too much, and without the help of AI, we would live a meaningless life. I believe that finding the balance between AI use and reality will lead to a healthier living.
