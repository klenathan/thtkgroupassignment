                        As the name suggests, VR technology creates simulated environments where users control animated characters with a 360 degree viewing angle. 
                        In recent years, many developers are able to simulate as many senses as possible, from vision, hearing to even touching and smelling. 
                        However, its content and device costs are the problems restricting VR’s development. To have this experience, a HMD ( Head-mounted device ) is used. 
                        There are many large VR companies who dominate the whole industry: Oculus, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive, Google Daydream View, Microsoft,…

                There will be dramatic change of people’s normal life ! Everything from working,studying, entertaining,.. will be completely different. For working, as mentioned above, there will be virtual training enviroment for each jobs. Businesses may utilize this technology to improve their employee's experience; for example, workers who perform dangerous tasks will be armed with practical information and will not have to worry about making mistakes. Same for studying purposes, VR technology provides students with a realistic, intelligible, and digestible approach that is far more engaging than books, documentaries, or movies. In this Virtual World, there will be locations appropriate for each topic. For example, in Biology, students and lecturers will be able to view cells, internal organs, and other little details that are not visible to the naked eye. Not only will we be able to save a significant amount of money on labotaries and scientific instruments such as microscopes and telescopes as a result of this, but this strategy will also make lessons more fascinating than ever before, increasing learning efficiency and knowledge memorization. When it comes to who will be impacted, I believe that the younger generation will be the primary target of this technology. Children's learning styles may vary dramatically, both for the better and for the worse, they will view genuine graphics and put what they have learnt into practice during their lessons. On the contrary, if we overuse this technology, user’s eyesight will be most affected by seeing the screen from a too near distance. Personally, I believe that virtual reality technology will eventually replace all office employment; instead of working in a real office, individuals would work in a virtual workplace at home in their animated character while still assuring productivity and efficiency, this will be very new and interesting if it become true !

                First and foremost, my methods of entertainment will be incredibly intriguing; playing games with hands-on movements will be more realistic, which will, of course, increase my satisfaction as a gamer. Same for communicating purpose, in my opinion, talking and interacting through VR will be great as we can appear in an animated character and have a wander around the virtual world with friends, families,etc. With VR, I can travel around the world, make more foreinger friends and have an insight into different culture from countries. Furthurmore, this will helps a lot with my studies, I can access to real images of what I have learnt and be able to practice in specified field, equip myself with solid knowledge base for working in the future. Studying languages will be more efficient because I will be able to readily discover foreigners with whom I can communicate in their languages, and they will be able to assist me in improving my vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. My parents will mostly utilize it for job purposes, but they will also be able to experience many new things that their age and physical condition do not permit. To summarize, VR technology has the potential to enhance people's lives in a variety of ways: individuals may enjoy unaffordable experiences without spending money, knowledge will be available in an engaging and effective manner, and people from all over the globe will be able to communicate and become closer.
